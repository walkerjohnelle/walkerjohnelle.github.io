        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my blog! I'm Johnelle, and this is my blog. I initially created it as part of the pre course work for the Skill Distillery&trade; bootcamp that I'll be attending. This was an exercise in utilizing HTML with which I've had some experience in the past. I've used resources like FreeCodeCamp&trade; to create mock coffee shop menus and explore web development. This journey has been a nice refresher and reminds me of why I enjoy working with HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            About me, I'm an Air Force Vet and currently undergoing a career change from intelligence analyst to software developer (more about that in a later post). In my free time, I enjoy traveling, appreciate great food, sports, movies, and music. Let's explore these interests together in my blog entries.
        </p>

        <h2> Why Skill Distillery&trade;?</h2>
        <p>
            So, there I was, a decade into my Air Force journey—ten years of solid service, remarkable experiences, and the prospect of a comfortable pension. Nevertheless, I couldn't ignore the creeping burnout and the waning passion for a job that had once defined me. It was time for a change.I decided to embark on a 3-week trip to Denver, a city with a special place in my heart as my best friend, who's practically a brother to me, had ventured into the world of software development at CACI after completing his Skill Distillery cohort. We had originally crossed paths in the Air Force, stationed together at a base near Sacramento. He had wrapped up his four-year service, taken a detour in the Air Force Reserves, worked as a security clearance investigator, and finally landed at Skill Distillery. He'd been gently nudging me toward this new path for a while, but it wasn't until that October in 2021 that I gave it serious thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my stay in Denver, I decided to dabble in coding, a field that had piqued my interest. The experience was intriguing, but it wasn't an immediate epiphany. Upon returning to Hawaii, my thoughts kept drifting back to my time in Denver, and I found myself working through coding exercises from freeCodeCamp&trade;. My interest grew, and I began to see the potential. My Air Force career, which I deeply cherished, had equipped me with a trove of valuable 'soft' skills. Yet, the allure of technical skills coupled with the creative canvas that coding offered was impossible to ignore. It was time to consider "what's next".
        </p>
        <p>
            Being single with no children, I realized that this was the perfect moment for a major career shift. The alternative—staying in a job that no longer fulfilled me—just didn't seem right. The process of transitioning from active duty to the reserves was set in motion (I mean, that pension though lol). I managed to secure an internship at Silicon Mountain Technologies&trade;, where I had the chance to collaborate with their programmers. This was my ticket to diving headfirst into the coding community, a stepping stone before officially enrolling in Skill Distillery&trade; Cohort SD42. Here I am now, writing this as part of the pre-work for Skill Distillery&trade;, on an HTML blog page that I built from the ground up. It's crazy how fast everything has unfolded. I'm so excited to begin this new challenge and tackle it with the same ferocity and determination as always. 
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://siliconmtn.com/open-source-software-in-defense/"target="_blank">Open Source Software in Defense</a></h2>
        <p>
            Prior to attending Skill Distillery&trade; I've spent the past few months interning for Silicon Mountain Technologies&trade; in Lakewood, CO. While working there, I had the chance to work on some interesting projects, providing my experience and insight from my previous life. One of which was writing a blog post for the company's website about the use of open source software in the defense industry. Here's a brief summary and the link is in the title.  
        </p>

        <p>
            In the realm of national defense, staying ahead of emerging threats is not only a priority, but a necessity. To achieve this, the Department of Defense (DoD) has been embracing open source software (OSS) as a powerful tool in its arsenal. OSS, with its transparent and collaborative nature, has become an essential asset in enabling the DoD to tackle challenges effectively, innovate rapidly, and enhance its capabilities while maintaining cost-efficiency.

        <h2>Favorite Movies from 2023:</h2>
        <p>
            Below is a list of my favorite movies from 2023, so far. Here, we have everything from an animated superhero film, to a couple of historical dramas, along with a surreal horror comedy, and a unbelievable documentary. I've linked the trailers just in case you're interested. 
            </p> 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/cqGjhVJWtEg?si=5hL9AW-w7f4-0E72"target="_blank">Spider-Man (Across the Spider-Verse)</a><p>
            So I enjoyed the first one, however, the second installment of the Spider-Verse series might of just ruined superhero movies for me for awhile. A lot of movies now are delving into the whole multiverse thing, but to me, this one did it best. Merging fan service with fresh storytelling, and incredible visuals, it sets the bar extremely high for telling old stories with a fresh take.</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/EP34Yoxs3FQ?si=t7QcvT38L2BNY3KZ"target="_blank">Killers of the Flower Moon</a><p>
            The trailer really threw me off. Initially, I saw the trailer and thought, sure that looks interesting enough, but when i heard it was 3.5 hours long, there was definitely a pause for concern. I barely got through Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman," and I was worried this would be another drawn out movie that would struggle to hold my interest. What I got was a very complex telling of a story that has repetedly been swept under the rug and that really needed to be told. I walked out feeling a wave of emotions and it's definitely a film that has stayed with me days after leaving the cinema.</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/PuiWDn976Ek?si=5_z5dHw738aDS5yK"target="_blank">Beau is Afraid</a><p>
            I love horror movies, especially ones written and directed by Ari Aster. So i was really excited to see this one. Another film with a 3 hour runtime on this list, the first watch was a lot to take in. I enjoyed it, and it definitely stuck with me, but it didn't make this list until i watched it again. There were so many nuances that I missed the first time or just didn't fully appreciate. It's definitely not for everyone, but for the people that will enjoy it, I think they'll love it!</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/bK6ldnjE3Y0?si=VFGLPH3lDWbQXm_y"target="_blank">Oppenheimer</a><p>
            Yet another 3 hour movie, I swear this isn't intentional! This movie needs no explination. The marketing campaign behind Barbenheimer ensured that there would be plenty of eyes on this one. It's a story that I've always been interested in, and I feel like it was told & acted extremely well. Despite the runtime, I felt like it used it's time very efficiently and I didn't even notice.</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/aevincEID5Y?si=Xu8IMJVPGZEhFa3h"target="_blank">BS High</a><p>
            I stumbled on this documentary one night as I struggled to find something to watch. I watched the trailer and figured I'd give it a shot. I was not ready for the ride I went on. I couldn't believe the lengths people would go to make a buck and the justifications people will make to validate their horrible actions.</p></li>
        </ul>

       <h2>Travel</h2>
<p>
    During my time in the Air Force, I was offered the opportunity to travel a ton for both work and personal. Not to sound too cliche, but the chance to see the world and experience different cultures has had a huge impact on my life and shaped the person that I am today. Here are a few of the places I've had the pleasure of traveling to.

        <h2>Sports</h2>
<p>
    Sports have and always will be a big part of my life! Ever seince i can remember I've had a basketball in my hand. Growing up I played basketball, foorball, baseball, ran track, and took up some combat sports. I think sports are an amazing metephore for life and playing/watching has always brought me a ton of joy. Here are some images that have epitomized those feelings! 
</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>
    If everything on this page is my life as at a snapshot, it would be incomplete without the soundrack. Music is a recalibrator, an infusion of energy, an excape. Here are some of my all time favorite albums.
</p>
<ul>
            <li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-kid-m-a-a-d-city-deluxe-version/1440818890"target="_blank">good kid, m.A.A.d city, Kendrick Lamar</a><p>
            My favorite album from my favorite rapper! This came out at the end of my first year at my first duty station. For the first time I started to feel homesick and this just sounded like home. I love how this is essentially a movie and it'll never ever get old!</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/bring-me-your-love/1240498964"target="_blank">Bring Me Your Love, City and Colour</a><p>
            If I'm ever in my feels, this is always a great go-to. Dallas Green's voice just mentally transports me to a completely different mood whenever I decide to give it a listen. I had the chance to see them live and that'll always be one of my favorite memories.</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/freudian/1265893523"target="_blank">Freudian, Daniel Caesar</a><p>
            Just one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard. Not a single skip on here! Every R&B album for me will be compared to this one. Something about it is just really personal.</p></li>
            <li><a href="hhttps://music.apple.com/us/album/if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late/1440839718"target="_blank">If You're Reading This It's Too Late, Drake</a><p>
            This came out while I was living in Europe and the memories I have traveling, listening to this, and figuring life out (still ongoing), will forever mentally transport me to that time which was very formative.</p></li>

            For the life of me, I can't remember how I stumbled on this gem and maybe that's part of the allure.
